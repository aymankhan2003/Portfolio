                                <p>Over the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to work with Fairbanks Museum and their research team to analyze their botanical data regarding the 
                                    bloom and fruit dates of the flowers in Vermont. My work had included manually entering data while also managing a online database called Zooniverse. 
                                    My main point of work was working in Python to use Tesseract a Machine Learning library to try to convert the physical images into an excel file.
                                    I later used that data to perform various analyses using R. I gained lots of experience in the field of data analysis using R, as I manipulated data, performed statistical analysis using the platform
                                    and created many visulazations relevant to the works of the research team. This internship helped me gain confidence in my data analysis skills as I learned from previous interns who also
                                    worked on the same project as I did.

                                <p>During the summer of 2022, I worked with Team4Tech as an Educational Technology Intern where I was a consultant for 
                                    the company in which my responsibilities entailed consulting the companies NGO partners sitauted in Malawi, and Rwanda on how to improve their business 
                                    models in a continental perspective. I also mentored a group of students as part of my responsibilities as the students aimed to build a website that would help 
                                    their respective communties. Overall, I worked with Adobe Illustrator a lot as the final deliverable was a digital handbook with the research that me and my team gathered
                                    in order to leave a physical guide for the company. I gained experience in working intensively with a team and communicating back and
                                    forth with them and our supervisors and the suboordinates of the NGO partners in order to give them the best work possible, while also working with market sizing scenarios, and 
                                    gaining skills in presenting my research to a organization that will use the research to grow and improve their business.

                                <p>This academic school year I have joined my college's software development club which is called MiddDev. The club focuses on 
                                    creating different software and apps for the college. One big software that the club create is called MiddCourses which can be found online.
                                    This year we are working on creating a software called MiddDash. MiddDash will serve as a food bridge to students. Whenever students feel ungry and they
                                    want food from the college store, then they can place a order on the app/website, then our software will send a notification to the whole school,
                                    and any student that is willing to make some money can bring that order to the student's dorm address. All payments will be handled by the students themselves where
                                    they will be doing transactions within themselves as again we are a school operated club trying to gain experience not profit. This club is giving me the experience to
                                    grow as a prospective software engineer giving me more backend experience, as I have been admitted into the club as a Backend Developer.
