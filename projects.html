                                <p>This project was a group effort from me and my friends. This predictor model predicts a soccer players market value and transfer fee based on their recent statistics. 
                                    We created this for a class final project and combined our interests for soccer with the lessons we took in from Machine Learning. We web scraped data, manipulated it, feature engineered it, 
                                    and tested and trained it for implementing our final model. Our project information is written more on a blog post that we created which can be accessed through the button below. 
                                    Our project also has a github repositary that includes all our UI, Machine Learning model, and R files. This project helped me personally grow in the field of data anlysis, machine larning and
                                    software development, while also improving my skills in working with a team on a complex project. I worked with R, Python, Javascript, HTML and some CSS in order to make a successful project.

                                <p>This project was also a group effort from me and my class peers. We created a Shiny dashboard that displays
                                    graphs and visualizations made using R. We took in global conflict data and manipulated it to show relational 
                                    comparisons between Intra-state conflicts and demographics. This project helped me improve my data anlysis skills
                                    a lot as I worked a lot with cleaning, merging and analysing data sets. I also improved my skills of creating 
                                    visualizations that are relevant to a specific task, and later display it through a public dashboard. I have a
                                    github repositary for this project where the main R code file of this project exists. The R code file is where we performed all our
                                    data manipulations and analysis and created the final shiny app.
