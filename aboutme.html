                <p>I was born in the Bronx, New York but later moved to a small country in South Asia called Bangladesh. I proudly call myself Bengali as that is the place
                    that shaped me into the person I am today. Being in both America and Bangladesh I have seen the technical differences and capabilities both places have. 
                    I want to use my skills in technology to help improve the differences and hopefully help in a general cause. I am someone who is skilled in Data Analysis, 
                    Machine Learning and Software Development. I am currently open to internship opportunities where I can learn from professionals working in existing companies 
                    and I myself would also like to help the goals of organziations using my current skillset. I love working with R, Python, and the front end development frameworks. 
                    I love using data to create meaningful visualizations and dashboards, and I also love using JavaScript and HTML to create beautiful websites that one day can be visible 
                    to people or one day this love of mine can be turned into a daily skillset I use to help a future company that will show interest in me.
